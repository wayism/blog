<p><em>Finding profound beauty in what others would discard</em></p>
<p>There they stand before Father Amitabha&rsquo;s gentle face—wilted lotus flowers, their edges browning, heads beginning to bow. Most would see only decay where beauty once was, and would rush to replace them. After all, they have served their purpose, haven&rsquo;t they? We&rsquo;re so quick to discard what&rsquo;s no longer perfect, the old, the wilted, the not-so-pretty.</p>
<p>But I cannot.</p>
<p>For days now, I&rsquo;ve watched their transformation with a fascination that comes from deep inside, as an observer invited to witness something sacred. These gentle soft pink lotuses, severed from their mother plant, were brought here with reverence—offerings to Father Amitabha on my small home shrine. They arrived in their prime, vibrant and perfect, performing their role with grace.</p>
<p>Then slowly, the dying crept in.</p>
<h2 id="the-art-of-letting-go">The Art of Letting Go</h2>
<p>First, the outer petals surrendered, dropping one by one at the feet of the Buddha statue like whispered prayers. I found myself picking them up, holding their softness between my fingers, feeling their once-firm texture now paper-thin and delicate.</p>
<p>What came next touched me unexpectedly. The remaining flower seemed to gather itself, as if realizing its entire being was falling apart, and with tremendous effort stood tall in its dying. There was dignity in this—a quiet, persistent beauty that spoke volumes about grace under pressure.</p>
<p>During my visits and studies in India, I watched garland-makers collect withered blooms from shrines to be returned to flowing water. Such offerings of beauty to the gods cannot be discarded as garbage. With the same reverence as the fresh flowers received, the dying flowers were given to the Ganges to continue their journey.</p>
<h2 id="witnessing-sacred-impermanence">Witnessing Sacred Impermanence</h2>
<p>I place my hand gently against Father Amitabha&rsquo;s warm wooden shoulder, as if both of us are witnessing this beautiful impermanence before us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cannot fulfill their true duty,&rdquo; I whisper to him, &ldquo;to nourish the seed pod, to complete the cycle of life.&rdquo; These flowers, cut for beauty alone, live brief lives of offering without continuation.</p>
<p>And yet&hellip;</p>
<p>I find myself gently touching each wilted bloom—sometimes absent-mindedly, other times with deep reverence. I&rsquo;m consoling them, taking their broken dreams and weaving the beauty of their offering into meaning. Their imperfection has been teaching me all along about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acceptance</strong> of what we cannot change</li>
<li><strong>Finding beauty</strong> in what is no longer perfect</li>
<li><strong>Holding onto</strong> what others want to discard</li>
<li><strong>Honoring</strong> the full arc of existence, not just the pretty parts</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-sacred-space">Creating Sacred Space</h2>
<p>Father Amitabha, lotus flowers, candles, and incense—this simple arrangement creates a sacred space for mending hearts, sharing blessings, restoring joy. It offers peace to those who seek the knowing that the divine is within reach, can be touched, can be spoken to right in our homes.</p>
<p>My photograph doesn&rsquo;t capture what I truly see. Maybe I didn&rsquo;t want it to. The image within me—the deep life lessons, the profound gratitude for witnessing this quiet transformation—cannot be captured or replaced with a picture-perfect image soon to be forgotten or discarded.</p>
<h2 id="the-teaching-in-imperfection">The Teaching in Imperfection</h2>
<p><strong>Perfection in imperfection.</strong> I am humbled. I am honored.</p>
<p>This simple scene has become my teacher, showing me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beauty doesn&rsquo;t end when perfection fades</li>
<li>Every stage of existence has its own dignity</li>
<li>What appears to be dying may actually be transforming</li>
<li>Sacred offerings continue their service even as they change form</li>
<li>True reverence honors the complete journey, not just the highlights</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-meditation-on-acceptance">A Meditation on Acceptance</h2>
<p>In our world that rushes to replace anything showing wear, these dying petals offer a different wisdom. They teach us to slow down, to witness, to find meaning in the spaces between perfect and discarded.</p>
<p>How often do we apply this same harsh standard to ourselves? Quick to dismiss our efforts when they&rsquo;re no longer perfect, ready to replace parts of ourselves that show age or wear, impatient with the natural cycles of growth and rest that mark authentic living.</p>
<p>The lotus petals whisper: <em>What if you honored your own seasons of change with the same gentle reverence?</em></p>
<h2 id="living-the-lesson">Living the Lesson</h2>
<p>As I continue tending my small shrine, I&rsquo;m learning a new kind of care—one that doesn&rsquo;t rush to fix or replace, but sits with what is. One that finds teaching in unexpected places and sees sacred purpose in every stage of the journey.</p>
<p>Amitabha watches.<br>
I watch.<br>
We witness together<br>
the perfection<br>
in what breaks<br>
and does not apologize.</p>
<p>In this simple practice of allowing dying flowers to complete their offering, I&rsquo;ve discovered a profound spiritual principle: every moment of existence, from fresh bloom to final petal fall, carries its own irreplaceable gift. Our task isn&rsquo;t to preserve perfection, but to witness transformation with reverence and find beauty in the courage it takes to change.</p>
<p><em>The dying petals teach us that endings, too, can be offerings.</em></p>
