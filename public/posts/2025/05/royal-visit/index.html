<p><em>When prehistoric wisdom comes calling at your door</em></p>
<p>This morning brought me an unexpected gift wrapped in scales and ancient dignity. Here, near my doorway in Puerto Vallarta, basked a male iguana of such magnificent proportions that my heart nearly forgot to beat. Four, perhaps five feet from nose to tail tip, he lay like a living piece of prehistory. And here I stood, barefoot, frozen in place, trying desperately not to squeal with excitement.</p>
<p>We engaged in that delicate dance that happens when two beings from different worlds meet—he with the measured wariness earned through generations of survival, I with barely contained joy threatening to bubble over at any moment.</p>
<h2 id="the-art-of-mutual-recognition">The Art of Mutual Recognition</h2>
<p>Time seemed to suspend itself as we regarded each other, neither willing to break the spell of this unexpected communion. Though I must confess, my hand trembled slightly as I tried to fumble for my phone without making sudden moves. Some moments simply beg to be captured, even if photos never quite do justice to the magic.</p>
<p>His scales caught the morning sun like burnished armor, creating patterns that would make any artist weep with envy. Yet beneath this regal bearing, I could see his ribs telling their own story of lean times and hard choices.</p>
<p>How strange that we humans often guard our vulnerabilities so carefully, while this magnificent creature wore his need without shame, his dignity intact despite his hunger. Looking at him, I felt a sudden kinship—haven&rsquo;t we all known what it is to be both magnificent and hungry at the same time?</p>
<h2 id="lessons-in-trust-and-presence">Lessons in Trust and Presence</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a teaching here about trust and presence, though I hardly dared breathe deeply enough to contemplate it in the moment! Despite his wariness, he chose to rest near a human dwelling, perhaps sensing on some level that here might be sanctuary.</p>
<p>Later, as I scattered food in his general direction (trying to appear casual while my heart danced with excitement), I thought about how often the universe works this way—bringing needs and resources together through seemingly chance encounters.</p>
<h3 id="what-this-royal-visitor-taught-me">What This Royal Visitor Taught Me</h3>
<p><strong>Perfect Presence</strong>: Unlike us humans who are always thinking about yesterday or tomorrow, my iguana guest was completely here, completely now. Every fiber of his being was engaged with the present moment.</p>
<p><strong>Authentic Being</strong>: He made no effort to appear other than he was—magnificent yet hungry, regal yet needy. There was no pretense, no social mask, just pure authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>Dignified Vulnerability</strong>: His hunger didn&rsquo;t diminish his nobility. He demonstrated that we can acknowledge our needs without losing our inherent worth.</p>
<p><strong>Measured Trust</strong>: He showed me how to be both open and cautious—willing to receive help while maintaining healthy boundaries.</p>
<h2 id="the-dance-of-interconnection">The Dance of Interconnection</h2>
<p>Being reminded of our interconnectedness, of how each being plays its part in the great dance of giving and receiving, I sensed an energy both prehistoric and immediate—of grace, of sunshine, of a child&rsquo;s pure delight. My heart sang with joy, filled with emotions my mind refuses to put into words.</p>
<p>We humans often rush past such moments, too busy seeking grand experiences to notice royalty resting in our own gardens. Yet here was a teacher wrapped in scales, demonstrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfect presence in each moment</li>
<li>Complete authenticity without apology</li>
<li>The delicate balance between caution and trust</li>
<li>How dignity and need can coexist beautifully</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sacred-encounters-in-ordinary-places">Sacred Encounters in Ordinary Places</h2>
<p>As I write this, my coffee long since cold and forgotten, I wonder if he&rsquo;ll find the food, if he&rsquo;ll choose to make this corner of the world part of his territory. But perhaps that&rsquo;s not what matters.</p>
<p>What matters is that for a few precious moments this morning, two very different children of creation shared space and time, each acknowledging the other&rsquo;s presence in their own way.</p>
<h3 id="the-deeper-teaching">The Deeper Teaching</h3>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t just a wildlife encounter—it was a reminder that the sacred shows up everywhere, often when we least expect it. The divine doesn&rsquo;t only speak through burning bushes or mountain peaks. Sometimes it arrives at our doorstep wearing scales, teaching us about:</p>
<p><strong>The courage to trust</strong> even when we&rsquo;re vulnerable<br>
<strong>The wisdom of perfect presence</strong> in whatever situation we find ourselves<br>
<strong>The beauty of authentic being</strong> without masks or pretense<br>
<strong>The mysterious ways</strong> needs and resources find each other</p>
<h2 id="an-invitation-to-wonder">An Invitation to Wonder</h2>
<p>How many royal visits do we miss because we&rsquo;re too busy, too distracted, too focused on our phones to notice the teachers that appear in our ordinary days?</p>
<p>My prehistoric visitor reminded me that wonder is always available if we&rsquo;re willing to slow down enough to receive it. He showed me that presence is a choice, that dignity is an inner quality that circumstances cannot touch, and that trust is a delicate dance requiring both openness and wisdom.</p>
<h3 id="a-practice-for-daily-life">A Practice for Daily Life</h3>
<p>The next time you encounter any creature—bird, cat, lizard, even an ant—try this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stop completely</strong> for just a moment</li>
<li><strong>Really look</strong> at the being before you</li>
<li><strong>Notice</strong> what they might be teaching through their way of being</li>
<li><strong>Ask yourself</strong>: What would it mean to live with their kind of presence?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-continuing-story">The Continuing Story</h2>
<p>In the end, isn&rsquo;t that what the WAY is all about? These small moments of connection, of seeing and being seen, of giving and receiving—each one a thread in the great tapestry of being, woven with both grace and human trembling.</p>
<p>My iguana teacher has moved on now, but the lesson remains. In a world that often feels disconnected and hurried, he reminded me that we&rsquo;re never alone, that teachers appear in the most unexpected forms, and that every encounter—no matter how brief—offers the possibility of wonder if we&rsquo;re present enough to receive it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most profound teachings come not from books or lectures, but from a moment of mutual recognition between two beings sharing the morning sun, each honoring the other&rsquo;s place in the vast, interconnected dance of existence.</p>
<p>The royal visit is over, but the teaching continues in every moment we choose presence over distraction, wonder over routine, connection over isolation.</p>
<p><em>Who might be visiting your doorstep today, wearing scales or feathers or fur, carrying ancient wisdom in forms you never expected?</em></p>
