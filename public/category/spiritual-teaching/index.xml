      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;beyond-cult-of-personality-the-wayist-approach-to-authentic-teaching&#34;&gt;Beyond Cult of Personality: The Wayist Approach to Authentic Teaching&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the message matters more than the messenger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People of theWAY have forever been cautious about setting themselves up as personalities, or following others based on charisma alone. We tend to let the message speak, not the personality. Sometimes, when the personality is too loud, you cannot even hear the message clearly. Many beginning students are so intent on judging a teaching&amp;rsquo;s importance based on how flamboyant the messenger appears that they miss the actual wisdom being offered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
