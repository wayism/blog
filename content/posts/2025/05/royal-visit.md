# A Royal Visit

*When prehistoric wisdom comes calling at your door*

This morning brought me an unexpected gift wrapped in scales and ancient dignity. Here, near my doorway in Puerto Vallarta, basked a male iguana of such magnificent proportions that my heart nearly forgot to beat. Four, perhaps five feet from nose to tail tip, he lay like a living piece of prehistory. And here I stood, barefoot, frozen in place, trying desperately not to squeal with excitement.

We engaged in that delicate dance that happens when two beings from different worlds meet—he with the measured wariness earned through generations of survival, I with barely contained joy threatening to bubble over at any moment.

## The Art of Mutual Recognition

Time seemed to suspend itself as we regarded each other, neither willing to break the spell of this unexpected communion. Though I must confess, my hand trembled slightly as I tried to fumble for my phone without making sudden moves. Some moments simply beg to be captured, even if photos never quite do justice to the magic.

His scales caught the morning sun like burnished armor, creating patterns that would make any artist weep with envy. Yet beneath this regal bearing, I could see his ribs telling their own story of lean times and hard choices.

How strange that we humans often guard our vulnerabilities so carefully, while this magnificent creature wore his need without shame, his dignity intact despite his hunger. Looking at him, I felt a sudden kinship—haven't we all known what it is to be both magnificent and hungry at the same time?

## Lessons in Trust and Presence

There's a teaching here about trust and presence, though I hardly dared breathe deeply enough to contemplate it in the moment! Despite his wariness, he chose to rest near a human dwelling, perhaps sensing on some level that here might be sanctuary.

Later, as I scattered food in his general direction (trying to appear casual while my heart danced with excitement), I thought about how often the universe works this way—bringing needs and resources together through seemingly chance encounters.

### What This Royal Visitor Taught Me

**Perfect Presence**: Unlike us humans who are always thinking about yesterday or tomorrow, my iguana guest was completely here, completely now. Every fiber of his being was engaged with the present moment.

**Authentic Being**: He made no effort to appear other than he was—magnificent yet hungry, regal yet needy. There was no pretense, no social mask, just pure authenticity.

**Dignified Vulnerability**: His hunger didn't diminish his nobility. He demonstrated that we can acknowledge our needs without losing our inherent worth.

**Measured Trust**: He showed me how to be both open and cautious—willing to receive help while maintaining healthy boundaries.

## The Dance of Interconnection

Being reminded of our interconnectedness, of how each being plays its part in the great dance of giving and receiving, I sensed an energy both prehistoric and immediate—of grace, of sunshine, of a child's pure delight. My heart sang with joy, filled with emotions my mind refuses to put into words.

We humans often rush past such moments, too busy seeking grand experiences to notice royalty resting in our own gardens. Yet here was a teacher wrapped in scales, demonstrating:

- Perfect presence in each moment
- Complete authenticity without apology  
- The delicate balance between caution and trust
- How dignity and need can coexist beautifully

## Sacred Encounters in Ordinary Places

As I write this, my coffee long since cold and forgotten, I wonder if he'll find the food, if he'll choose to make this corner of the world part of his territory. But perhaps that's not what matters.

What matters is that for a few precious moments this morning, two very different children of creation shared space and time, each acknowledging the other's presence in their own way.

### The Deeper Teaching

This wasn't just a wildlife encounter—it was a reminder that the sacred shows up everywhere, often when we least expect it. The divine doesn't only speak through burning bushes or mountain peaks. Sometimes it arrives at our doorstep wearing scales, teaching us about:

**The courage to trust** even when we're vulnerable  
**The wisdom of perfect presence** in whatever situation we find ourselves  
**The beauty of authentic being** without masks or pretense  
**The mysterious ways** needs and resources find each other

## An Invitation to Wonder

How many royal visits do we miss because we're too busy, too distracted, too focused on our phones to notice the teachers that appear in our ordinary days?

My prehistoric visitor reminded me that wonder is always available if we're willing to slow down enough to receive it. He showed me that presence is a choice, that dignity is an inner quality that circumstances cannot touch, and that trust is a delicate dance requiring both openness and wisdom.

### A Practice for Daily Life

The next time you encounter any creature—bird, cat, lizard, even an ant—try this:

1. **Stop completely** for just a moment
2. **Really look** at the being before you
3. **Notice** what they might be teaching through their way of being
4. **Ask yourself**: What would it mean to live with their kind of presence?

## The Continuing Story

In the end, isn't that what the WAY is all about? These small moments of connection, of seeing and being seen, of giving and receiving—each one a thread in the great tapestry of being, woven with both grace and human trembling.

My iguana teacher has moved on now, but the lesson remains. In a world that often feels disconnected and hurried, he reminded me that we're never alone, that teachers appear in the most unexpected forms, and that every encounter—no matter how brief—offers the possibility of wonder if we're present enough to receive it.

Sometimes the most profound teachings come not from books or lectures, but from a moment of mutual recognition between two beings sharing the morning sun, each honoring the other's place in the vast, interconnected dance of existence.

The royal visit is over, but the teaching continues in every moment we choose presence over distraction, wonder over routine, connection over isolation.
