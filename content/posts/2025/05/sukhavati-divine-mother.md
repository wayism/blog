# Sukhavati: Divine Mother's Embrace

*Our true home where love flows as freely as light from the sun*

There are moments, usually in the quiet hours before dawn, when the veil between worlds grows thin and we catch glimpses of something greater than our earthly understanding. Perhaps it's the way morning mist transforms ordinary gardens into mystical realms, or how the first bird's song seems to carry echoes of celestial music. In these moments, I often find my thoughts turning to Sukhavati—not as some distant paradise, but as our true home, the place our souls recognize even if our minds cannot yet fully comprehend it.

## More Than a Destination

In the story of Mari of Magadha, we learn how Jesus described Sukhavati to her that first evening in Srinagar: "Spirit-Heaven, yes. Where souls go when they graduate from Butterfly Path, this school of life." But it's so much more than just a destination.

Imagine the most loving family gathering you've ever experienced—that feeling of complete acceptance, of being known and loved exactly as you are. Now multiply that feeling infinitely, and you begin to glimpse the nature of Sukhavati's divine family.

Here, God our Father and God our Mother work in perfect harmony, their yang and yin energies dancing in eternal balance. Like parents who delight in their children's growth while giving them space to learn and develop, they oversee our soul's evolution with infinite patience and wisdom.

## The Divine Family

Around our Divine Parents gather all the great enlightened ones—Buddha, Krishna, Durga, Parvati, Avalokiteshvara—not as distant deities demanding worship, but as elder siblings in our celestial family, each expressing divine love in their unique way.

Think of how a lotus opens its petals one by one, each movement perfectly timed, each stage essential to its blooming. This is how souls unfold in Sukhavati. There's no rush, no judgment, no comparison. Each being develops according to their own nature, supported by the loving guidance of those who have gone before.

The Taras, like Mari herself, serve as gentle bridges between worlds, helping us navigate the sometimes turbulent waters of spiritual growth.

## What Makes Sukhavati Different

What makes Sukhavati different from other concepts of heaven? Here, there are no golden streets or pearly gates, no rewards and punishments, no separation between sacred and everyday life.

Instead, imagine a realm where:
- Every moment is filled with the joy of discovery
- Learning and growing are as natural as breathing  
- Love flows as freely as light from the sun
- Beauty exists beyond anything we can imagine on Earth

It's not a place of eternal rest, but of eternal becoming—a place where souls continue to grow and develop in the embrace of infinite love.

## A Realm of Infinite Beauty

The air itself seems to shimmer with possibility. Colors we have no earthly names for dance before our eyes. Music rises not from instruments but from the very fabric of reality—the harmony of countless souls growing, learning, loving.

Everything of beauty we experience on Earth is just a shadow, a hint of the profound beauty that awaits us in Sukhavati. The most magnificent sunset, the most perfect flower, the most moving piece of music—these are like small letters from home, reminders of the infinite beauty that is our birthright.

## Why We Recognize It as Home

Why does this description make something deep within us respond with recognition? Perhaps because deep in our hearts, we already know it is home.

Every act of kindness, every moment of genuine connection, every flash of insight that makes us gasp with wonder—these are like messages from home, reminders of where we came from and where we're returning.

In Sukhavati, the love we've glimpsed in our brightest moments becomes the very air we breathe. The peace we've tasted in meditation becomes our constant state. The joy we've felt in moments of perfect connection becomes the background music of existence.

## The Path Home

Mari's story teaches us that this heaven isn't earned through perfect behavior or correct beliefs, but through the gradual opening of our hearts to ever-greater love and wisdom. Each challenge we face on Earth is like a facet being polished on a precious stone, preparing us to reflect more of heaven's light.

The journey to Sukhavati isn't about escaping Earth's difficulties—it's about transforming through them. Every moment of patience we develop, every act of compassion we perform, every time we choose love over fear, we're preparing ourselves for full citizenship in the divine realm.

## Already Touching Its Shores

The gateway to Sukhavati stands open, closer than our own breath. In those quiet moments when we feel most authentically ourselves, most deeply connected to all that is, we're already touching its shores.

Our task isn't to earn our way there but to remember that it is where we truly belong—in that perfect balance of divine mother-love and father-wisdom, surrounded by enlightened beings who guide us with infinite patience and compassion.

### Signs We're Already Connected

You might already be experiencing touches of Sukhavati when:
- Love flows through you without effort or expectation
- Beauty moves you to tears of gratitude
- You feel deeply connected to all living beings
- Peace fills you even in difficult circumstances
- Wisdom arises naturally in challenging situations
- Joy bubbles up from within for no particular reason

## The Promise Fulfilled

This is the promise that Mari discovered in that small room in Srinagar, that transformed her from a wounded child to a being of light: that no matter how far we seem to have wandered, no matter how dark our path may appear, we are always just one heartbeat away from home.

Sukhavati isn't waiting for us at the end of some distant journey—it's available now, in every moment we choose love, in every breath filled with gratitude, in every act of kindness that flows from our expanding hearts.

The divine mother's embrace surrounds us always. We need only stop struggling long enough to feel her arms around us, hear her whisper that we are loved beyond measure, and know that home was never lost—we had simply forgotten how to see it.

## A Daily Practice

To strengthen your connection with Sukhavati:

**Morning**: Upon waking, spend a moment feeling yourself held in divine love
**During the day**: Notice moments of beauty as letters from home
**Evening**: Offer gratitude for all the ways love showed up in your day
**Before sleep**: Rest in the knowledge that you are eternally beloved

*Om Tare Tuttare Ture Svaha*

The mantra that opens the heart to Tara's guidance and reminds us that home is always within reach.
